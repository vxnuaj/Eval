Great, since you have a PostgreSQL database dump, let's break this into concrete steps to set up the evaluation system.  

---

## **Step 1: Restore the PostgreSQL Database**
Since you have the dump file, you need to restore it into a local PostgreSQL instance.

### **1.1 Start PostgreSQL**  
If it's not running, start your PostgreSQL instance.  
For Mac (Homebrew installation):  
```bash
brew services start postgresql
```
For Linux:  
```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### **1.2 Create Database and Restore Dump**
```bash
createdb my_eval_db  # Create a database
psql -d my_eval_db -f path_to_your_dump.sql  # Restore dump
```
Check if the table was created:  
```sql
\c my_eval_db;
SELECT * FROM public.attribute;
```

---

## **Step 2: Connect to PostgreSQL from Python**
You'll need `psycopg2` or `asyncpg` to interact with PostgreSQL.

### **2.1 Install psycopg2**
```bash
pip install psycopg2
```

### **2.2 Connect to the Database**
```python
import psycopg2

def connect_db():
    """Connects to PostgreSQL and returns a connection object."""
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname="my_eval_db",
        user="root",
        password="your_password",
        host="localhost",
        port=5432
    )
    return conn

def test_connection():
    conn = connect_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM public.attribute;")
    print(cursor.fetchall())  # Print data to verify
    conn.close()

test_connection()
```

---

## **Step 3: Execute and Validate SQL Queries**
We need a function to execute generated SQL queries against the database.

```python
def execute_query(query):
    """Executes a SQL query and returns results or error."""
    conn = connect_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query)
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        return result, True  # Query executed successfully
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e), False  # Query failed
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM public.attribute;"
result, success = execute_query(query)
print("Query Result:", result if success else "Error:", result)
```

---

## **Step 4: Implement SQL Generation and Evaluation Loop**
Since you mentioned generating SQL queries iteratively (max `n` steps), we can now implement a step-wise evaluation function.

```python
MAX_STEPS = 20

def generate_sql(question):
    """Stub function - Replace with actual model inference."""
    return "SELECT * FROM public.attribute;"  # Dummy response for now

def evaluate_query(question, expected_sql):
    """Runs iterative evaluation until the correct SQL is generated."""
    for attempt in range(1, MAX_STEPS + 1):
        generated_sql = generate_sql(question)
        result, success = execute_query(generated_sql)
        
        # Check correctness
        expected_result, _ = execute_query(expected_sql)
        if success and result == expected_result:
            return {"query": generated_sql, "steps": attempt, "correct": True}

    return {"query": None, "steps": MAX_STEPS, "correct": False}
```

---

## **Step 5: Compute Evaluation Metrics**
Once we run multiple queries, we can compute performance metrics.

```python
def compute_metrics(results):
    accuracy = sum(1 for r in results if r["correct"]) / len(results)
    avg_steps = sum(r["steps"] for r in results) / len(results)

    print(f"Execution Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
    print(f"Average Steps Taken: {avg_steps}")
```

---

## **Next Steps**
1. **Set up your database** – Restore dump & connect.  
2. **Test execution function** – Ensure you can run SQL queries.  
3. **Implement model inference** – Replace `generate_sql()`.  
4. **Run evaluation** – Feed questions and compute metrics.
